# appscript-docusign
#### A serverless project using [Google App Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) and [DocuSign API](https://www.docusign.com/products/apis) to request e-signature via email

#### No separate server is required, which means you can host it within your Gmail or Google Workspace (G Suite) account without extra cost!

* It takes quite a while to submit the e-signature request thru DocuSign API, the progress loading below is normal
